# UNO

Uno is an American shedding-type card game that is played with a specially printed deck. The game's general principles put it into the Crazy Eights family of card games, and it is similar to the traditional European game Mau-Mau.

# Description

This game was developed in the spring of 2020 for AP assignment.

# Code

I used object-oriented programming to develop this game.
